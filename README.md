Project Description
-------------------
Our client, **Prime Digital Academy: Room 3**, has asked for an app to simulate the behavior of their shelf. That is, a list of items placed on the classroom shelf.

Any visitor to the page can view the shelf, but only logged in users should be able to place objects on the shelf.

This will require some research, design, an implementation. Include a readme.md that includes the names of the group members and your team name/number. As well as any planning/docs. These can be in digital format or even pics of whiteboard/notebook sketches.

Shelf Object
------------
Items placed on the shelf should have the following data:

* description
* placer (user)
* image url (optional)

You're going to have to think about how/where to store this data. Recall that each item will have to be associated with a user!

Hard Mode
----------
* only logged in users can remove objects from the shelf
* styling

Pro Mode
--------
* logged in users can only remove their objects from the shelf
* show list of users only to logged in users

Super Mode
----------
* filter output by user (click on a user to only show items by that user)
* users can re-order shelf
